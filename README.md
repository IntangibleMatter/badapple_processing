A Bad Apple display made in [Processing](https://processing.org/) framework using [Marching Squares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marching_squares)

USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Unzip `apple.csv.zip` into `data/`
2. Make sure you have `Sound` installed
3. Run!

I needed to zip the CSV file containing the frame data because it was 44mb unzipped, and github only allows up to 25mb.

Enjoy the show!

(All code by me)
